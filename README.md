# CS521 Final Project (Artifact)

## 1. Abstract
This is the artifact of the CS521 final project.
In this artifact, we provide the source code of T10's compilation, simulation, and evaluation framework. Then, we guide readers to explore the tradeoff between compilation time and execution performance. To run this artifact, please use a Linux machine with at least 200 GB of main memory and at least 20 GB of disk space.

## 2. Artifact Checklist
- **Algorithm**: Inductive tensor operator scheduling, cost-aware on-chip memory allocation, and ICCA chip design space exploration.
- **Neural Network Models**: Llama2-13B, Gemma2-27B, OPT-30B, Llama2-70B, and DIT-XL. Their execution graphs are included in the repo.
- **Run-time environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 or newer, Python 3.10.
- **Metrics**: Execution time, hardware utilization.
- **Output**: Trace files and result figures.
- **Experiments**: Generate experiments using supplied scripts.
- **How much main memory required (approximately)**: 200 GB
- **How much disk space required (approximately)**: 20 GB
- **How much time to prepare workflow (approximately)**: 10 minutes
- **How much time to complete experiments (approximately)**: 30 hours on a machine with 64 CPU cores and 200 GB main memory.

## 3. Description

### 3.1 Hardware Dependencies
The T10's simulation and evaluation framework can run on any x86 machine with at least 200 GB of main memory and at least 20 GB of disk space.

### 3.2 Software Dependencies
The framework needs a Linux environment (preferably Ubuntu) with Python 3.10 installed.

## 4. Installation
1. Start by downloading the artifact from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yiqiliu2/CS521-Final.git
   cd CS521-Final
   ```

2. Please make sure all prerequisites are successfully installed:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.10 tmux -y
   curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10
   python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 5. Experiment Workflow
To compile DL models into programs and obtain program execution traces from the Elk simulator, we provide a one-click script `benchmark_scripts/generate_data_from_sim.py` for you to launch all test cases in one place. However, the script may take more than 30 hours to finish, so we recommend using `tmux`:
```bash
tmux
```
Then, run the one-click script within the new tmux terminal:
```bash
python3.10 benchmark_scripts/generate_data_from_sim.py
```
To return from the tmux terminal without pausing the script, press `Ctrl+B` and then press `D` on your keyboard. To attach back to the original tmux terminal where the script is running, use:
```bash
tmux attach -t 0
```
For more tips on using tmux, refer to [https://tmuxcheatsheet.com](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com).

### 5.1 Handle Errors
If the script encounters an error, the most common cause is that the artifact runs on too many CPU cores and overflows the main memory. In such events, (1) go to `launch.py`, (2) change the `CORE_REDUCE` macro in line 22 to a larger value (e.g., `CORE_REDUCE=8`), and (3) rerun the script:
```bash
python3.10 benchmark_scripts/generate_data_from_sim.py
```
The script should automatically skip any completed test cases and resume from the failed one.

## 6. Evaluation and Expected Results
After the completion of all experiments, please run the following script to evaluate the results:
```bash
python3.10 plot_comparison.py
python3.10 plot_sensitivity_analysis.py
python3.10 plot_trends.py
```
This script gathers all data from the execution trace and draws all figures. To verify the results, one can compare the generated figures with those in the paper.
